Designed version

Placeholder design notes (no original assets included):

- Backlog cards are grey, in-progress cards are blue, complete cards are green.
- Swimlane columns use the class `Swimlane-column` for layout and styling.
- Drag handles are the full card area; Dragula provides drag interactions.
- The Shipping Requests view places all tasks into the Backlog swimlane on first load.
